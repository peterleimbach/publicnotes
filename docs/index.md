# Peter's Notebook

This is my public notebook, where I write down texts that I use elsewhere.

I do it in a public form because I like to share information and nothing secret is published here.

Especially when new participants want to contribute to the AndroidAPS documentation, this is very handy.

p.s. And of course I just enjoy playing with Markdown, MKDocs, Github etc. and learning something new. ;-)

This is a test.
